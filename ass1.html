				<h2>The importance of IT in modern business</h2>
				<p>Any business, big or small, all rely on IT to operate. Without it the business would ultimately come to a standstill. IT is needed to communicate with all stakeholders, internal and external. It also provides a business with a lot of data and insight. From this a company is then able to develop its existing systems and processes to grow. The world has evolved from papaer to electronic and without the IT in place businesses would simply fail to operate. It is therefore extremely important that businesses have strong cyber secuirty to protect their records and classifield information.<a href="https://www.oksbdc.org/why-is-technology-important-in-business/">.[1]</a></p>

				<h2>Methods, Skills and Resources</h2>
				<p>To make this possible a business must have an IS (Information services) team in place. These teams are generally made up of web developers and designers. With the correct skillset in coding they are able to retrieve information input in to the website to generate new products. Most developers of a high level would be seamless in using web languages such as javascript, HTML and CSS. There are also various other languages that are used such as Python, PHP and much more.<a href="https://thenextscoop.com/web-design-techniques-2018/">.[2]</a> </p>

				<h2>Plan and Carry Out Tasks</h2>
				<p>Before any project begins it is best practice to prepare and plan what you are going to do. A popular planning website that IT teams use is Trello. This allows them to map out their project and break it down in to individual smaller projects which will ultimately become the end project when all tied together and completed. By using trello boards everyone who is given access to it can see what other teams are working on, timescales and which areas need to be prioritised on over others. Alternatively, there is nothing wrong with a large wall and plenty of post-stick notes to map out your project.<a href="https://www.interruptdelivers.com/themash/what-is-risk-in-a-digital-project-and-why-should-i-care">.[3]</a></p><br>

				<h2>The risks that might impact digital projects</h2>
				<p>When working on a project it is best to try and remain as agile as possible. The digital landscape is constantly changing and updated systems and releases are regular. If you have a clear goal in mind and focus on this entirely it is possible that upon completion you may have found that the consumers no longer require what you have made, or a competitor has beaten you to ther mark. Businesses are required to remain innovative to stay ahead of the game and avoid a failed project which costs businesses millions.</p><a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/tag/gdpr/">.[4]</a></p></p><br>

                    <h2>How I would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>
                    <p>Various factors will determine what systems and software you would consider using for your project. Is your project small or large scale? Who is your audience? What devices do you want it to be accessible on? Do they need to have developers recruited who are specialists in javascript or python? All these are examples of what businesses need to understand and decide before they begin their project. There are plenty of different systems that could be used when writing code such as codepen and visual studio code. Generally it is down to personal preference for what developers and businesses use.

                    <h2>How Trello and Github Has Helped me</h2>
                    <p>Trello has been great for organising my work. Seperating the different cards in tho what needs to be done, has been done, and will be done. I am still finding out more from Trello so i hope to utilise its strengths.</p><a href="https://trello.com/enf">[5]</a>

                    <h2>How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
                        <p>In 2018 GDPR regulations were updated for the first time in over two decades. Businesses had to move quickly to make sure that they were comnpliant with these regulations. This included making sure all the sensitive data they kept on customers and staff were securely stored and anything that was considered to not be needed was removed from their databases. Businesses would also need to change the way they market themselves as no longer being allowed to opt customers in to markleting emails and dependent on the size of the business this could of been a large undertaking to finish before the updated GDPR regulations went live. However it could be expected that if a business had a strong code behind they would only need to update certain things once and these would filter through to all other areas of the website. Another reason to have a great team of developers working on any business and avoid any fines.<a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/tag/gdpr/">.[6]</a> </p>

				<h2>Review Of My Site</h2>
			<p>Upon review of my website I am happy that I used visual studio code to write my code in. The VS code application is easily accessible for junior developers and is free to download and use. This then gave me the option  to continue with my website out of hours and preventing me from being limited to working on it at codenation.</p><br>
			<p>Looking back now I am glad i used trello to map out my website beforehand. This helped me break down what I needed to do in to smaller projects and give me a clear indication of what I was working on and what I would be doing next. As I followed this planning I was been able to visually see where I was at.</p><br>
			<p>Overall I don’t think my website is very clearly a consultancy website. If I was to re-do it or add to my project I would add additional pages that had an ‘about me’ section and pages that showcased other works I had done. This would include test pages and images of these works. If I had this as a page it would then be easy to add more examples to it as I completed future projects.</p> <br>
			<p>To access these  pages I would have a sidebar on the left with the links that would remain permanently in place whilst the right side would still be able to be scrolled on. The pros about my website is that it is very accessible as everything is included in one page, streamlined and easy to read as I chose to use white text on a black background. I tried to take inspiration from other websites such as my portfolio [6]<a href="http://iammickwhite.com">site</a> that has a sleek design.</p>

					<h2> The benefits and drawbacks</h2>
					<h3>Could i have been more efficient
						when making my website? How? Could I have
						done it in teams? </h3>

				<p>Always room for improvement. But personally i cannot see me changing much if anything for <b>this</b> site. I would of prefered more time to design. But i think where i went wrong was i did not plan <b>enough</b>, especially with trello and other tools readily available. I suppose my lack of knowledge, and experience reflects this. I definetly believe that if i had done this project in a team it would be much better. Reason!. I'm not (at the moment)knowledgeable enough to see every angle, scope, and tools available (plus their efficiency).</p><br>
				<h3>Using a Web Development Framework.</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Having features providing solutions to those common web development problems (e.g. standard web page layouts, functions for dealing with web forms, and browser compatibility fixes).</li>
					<Li>Tested by many other members of our development team for bugs, security and performance.</Li>
					<li>Extensions and tools that further enhance development (for example, many js libraries provide fast development).</li>
					<li>Having a development team of developers I can reach out to for help and collaboration.</li>
					<li>Typically are easier for beginners to start using.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Improve Productivity and efficiency</h3>
				<p>An age old saying is "There’s no reason to reinvent the wheel". Recycle your code!. I would create a collection of my favourite and often-used code to make sure that it’s easily reachable and organized.</p>
		<h3>Developing Solutions To Improve My Productivity Using IT</h3>			<p>I think i would prepare much better. reason being i didn't know some of the software i was using, it was trial and error for me. But of course in time as i keep using these tools, and find out many other ways to complete said tasks, i can grow with every project.</p>			<p>Working in a team was a great experiience for me. We was able to designate different roles to each member so that as we build together, we set the rights, wrongs, and direction of the task in hand.</p>
		<p>Slack has been great for sharing important information, advice and overall solutions to my own development, and of course my pages development. I will keep on using slack in the future, it has many opotions available, plus what i don’t already know. </p>
		<h3> How I Would Go About Testing Digital Solutions </h3>
		<p>I would have a set path of what i plan to conquer in developing a project. </p>
		<p>What will be the overriding objective i want my digital marketing efforts to achieve (for example do i want to position my prject as something i could look back and think: Yeah! Mission complete.</p>
		<p>Analyse The Past (Learn From Your Mistakes)</p>
		<p>Create a plan i don’t stick to. My plan is never going to be perfect from the outset. Not everything i make is going to be correct on the off.
		Although i’ve taken a lot of care to. I will always be prepared to adapt and look for other ways of completing the task in hand..</p>
