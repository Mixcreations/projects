				<h2>Who Am I</h2>
				<p>I'm a highly focused coder and continue to hone my skills on a daily basis. Organised, methodical and a keen eye for detail in coding and various software. Currently improving my skills and knowledge in the Agile Methodologies, TDD, BDD, and SOLID. Also learning the Angular Js Library. The main area of interest is Javascript. But my focus is on working in Cybersecurity.</p>

				<h2>Why Codenation</h2>
				<p>Where do i start. I have always had an interest in computers, and more recently how the internet works etc. I have worked on some personal projects, created various online designs, and have an active online prsesnce. But though iv'e tried, i never seemed to get the opportunity that i yearned for. Codenation has seemed to bridge that gap i have been in. I feel it is set up for people like myself to find my niche and help me grow, and finally find a place in the industry. The hot chocolate is lovely too. </p>
