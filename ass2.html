		<strong>I am setting up as an independent consultant, which is very
			exciting, however, i'm going to need a website of my own
			to highlight my skills, availability and areas of work. Itâ€™s time
			for me to create a website that details me, and including
			pages/sections and a how i built the page: </strong>

				<h2>Describing the content and layout for each page </h2>
				<p>My pages will explain a bit about myself, why i am at Codenation, various explanations and reasonings on the inner workings of an IT business. It will set the paths needed to have a successful IT business, or one that relies on IT. I have set out various pages explaining different content, these are accessible by the tab type buttons at the top of my pages you would commonly see on most websites thes days. I have the different sections laid out vertically, seperated by dotted horizontal lines on each section. There is a sidebar on each page where i will add my own side comments relating to each section. I have a colourful header banner that doesn't impact too much on content, and a small picture of myself to the left of this. </p>

				<h2>Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
				<p>First of all any images i would use, specifically speaking for instance of Google (as i use this search engine - mainly) i will use the search abilities provided such as Images tab then under it Usage rights, and select the appropriate option that protects me from copyright infringement. Any text i may use i will reference it by adding a number at the end of its text, and providing a jump link to its source.</p>

				<h2> Access issues that need taking into account - issues that people with
					disabilities may face</h2>
				<p>My page is simple, it loads on one page (though i am aware of js libraries - Angular, React etc, that can go one step further in ease of loading pages) and is accesible to a wide community of people. I know i can further improve this. The fact my page scrolls down the middle i feel is great for those with disabilities, as there isn't too much clicking around for new content, i can even help this further.</p>

				<h2>The appropriate filetypes for websites </h2>
				<p>Obviously i have used html5 for the structure of my site. This adheres to <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4923/web-30"> web 3.0</a>. I have used this 3.0 correct tags so that it is the correct standard in todays modern Internet useage world. Alongside this i also used another one of the stanadrds: CSS3. Although i have not gone overboard with css because i didn't want, or need, to implement too much design. I focused more on content, rather than asthetics. I used a mixture of image types (png, jpg).</p>
